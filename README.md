# NeuraMesh Protocol (NMP)

Custom UDP-based transport protocol for distributed AI inference across Apple device meshes.
NACK-only reliability, XOR FEC, 1-RTT Noise IK handshake, AES-256-GCM per session.

**Status: Phases 1–6 + 8–9 complete.** Core transport (Phase 1: handshake + encryption +
sequencing), NACK-only reliability with a 64-packet retransmission window and sliding
replay window (Phase 2), XOR FEC over 4-packet groups + AWDL contention suppression
(Phase 3: sub-millisecond loss recovery, ~75× faster than the NACK path),
zero-configuration mesh assembly (Phase 4: Bonjour/mDNS discovery, capability
advertisement via TXT records, deterministic coordinator election), sharded multi-peer
inference (Phase 5: GGUF parsing, proportional layer sharding, pipelined orchestration,
bit-exact output at 1.02× single-device latency), production hardening (Phase 6:
peer-drop detection + failover with 0.4 ms re-sharding, stage retry under unrecoverable
loss, web testing dashboard, comprehensive benchmark suite), **real LLM inference
(Phase 8: llama.cpp behind the engine seam — quantized GGUF models, coordinator holds
only the tokenizer, weights on the peer, every token one real mesh round trip; see
`Docs/Phase8_Design.md`)**, and **the fast mesh (Phase 9: benchmark-driven adaptive
layer sharding with persisted device profiles, zero-trim + mixed-precision activation
wire formats, pipeline-parallel batch execution, draft/verify speculative decoding,
one-command auto-configuration; see `Docs/Phase9_Design.md`)**.
**272 tests pass, 0 failures.**

## Requirements

- Xcode 14.2+ / Swift 5.8+
- macOS 13+ or iOS 16+ (Network.framework, CryptoKit)

## Build, Test & Run

```bash
cd NeuraMeshProtocol
swift build
swift test                             # 272 unit + loopback integration tests

swift run nmp-peer                     # compute peer (cross-device mesh)
swift run nmp-coordinator              # coordinator + cross-device benchmark
swift run nmp-dashboard                # testing dashboard on http://localhost:8080
swift run nmp-dashboard --benchmark    # headless benchmark suite → Results/*.csv
```

### Real LLM inference (Phase 8)

```bash
brew install llama.cpp && scripts/setup_llama.sh    # one-time: build the shim

# single device / full-stack-in-one-process (POST /api/inference for text):
swift run nmp-dashboard --engine llamaCpp --model ~/models/model.gguf --placement local
swift run nmp-dashboard --engine llamaCpp --model ~/models/model.gguf   # remote shard

# real two-process / two-device mesh (weights on the peer, tokenizer on the coordinator):
swift run nmp-peer        --engine llamaCpp --model ~/models/model.gguf
swift run nmp-coordinator --engine llamaCpp --model ~/models/model.gguf \
                          --prompt "The capital of France is" --tokens 16
```

A llama plan is one full-range shard — llama.cpp cannot execute layer
sub-ranges, so "distributed" means real remote execution over the real
transport, with greedy sampling making output identical across placements.
Step-by-step guide, measured results, and the design rationale:
`Docs/Phase8_Design.md`.

### Fast mesh (Phase 9): one-command setup, compressed wire, speculation

```bash
swift run nmp-dashboard --auto-config              # reference mesh: probe → balance → persist
swift run nmp-dashboard --engine llamaCpp --model ~/models/model.gguf \
                        --auto-config              # llama: zero-trim wire (lossless, ~99% smaller)

# speculative decoding: drafts locally, verifies a whole draft in ONE round trip
curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/inference \
     -d '{"prompt":"...","max_tokens":32,"enable_speculation":true}'
# or serve everything speculatively, optionally with a small same-vocab draft model:
swift run nmp-dashboard --engine llamaCpp --model ~/models/model.gguf \
                        --auto-config --speculation [--draft-model small.gguf]

# real two-process mesh with the same levers:
swift run nmp-coordinator --engine llamaCpp --model ~/models/model.gguf \
                          --prompt "..." --tokens 32 --speculation --zero-trim
```

Auto-config benchmarks each device with real probe passes, balances layer
spans to the measured speeds, persists the profile (`~/.nmp/`), and picks
the wire format. Speculative output is token-for-token identical to plain
greedy output — drafts only ever save round trips, never change text.

Or open the folder directly in Xcode (`File > Open…`) — SwiftPM packages open natively;
no `.xcodeproj` is required or checked in. Cross-device setup (Mac coordinator +
iPhone peer): see `Docs/CrossDevice_Setup_Guide.md`.
